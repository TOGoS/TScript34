# TS34-P12-Lib01

This project is an attempt to make a Maven package.

## FAQ

### Can I publish to Maven Central?

No.  The list of steps is too long.

### Can I publish to JitPack?

No.  It won't let you use your proper `groupId` and `artifactId` or `version`.
It derives those itself using your GitHub username, project name, and tag.
Which arguably is a simpler way to do things, but maybe you don't want to
couple the name of your proect to where it happens to be hosted.

### Can I get GitHub to build and host packages for me?

[Maybe](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-maven)!
